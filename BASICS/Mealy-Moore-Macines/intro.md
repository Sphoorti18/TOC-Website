| Comparison Aspect      | Moore Machine                                                                 | Mealy Machine                                                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Output Generation      | Output depends only on the current state.                                      | Output depends on the current state and the input symbol.                                       |
| State Diagram          | States are labeled with outputs.                                               | Transitions are labeled with outputs.                                                          |
| Complexity             | May require more states for the same functionality.                            | Can have fewer states for the same functionality.                                              |
| Timing of Output       | Output is associated with states.                                              | Output is associated with transitions.                                                         |
| Simplicity             | Conceptually simpler and easier to design.                                     | More complex due to output dependency on input.                                                |
| Applications           | Used where output timing is critical.                                          | Used where quick output reaction to input changes is critical.                                 |
| Output Changes         | Outputs change only at state boundaries.                                       | Outputs can change in the middle of transitions.                                               |
